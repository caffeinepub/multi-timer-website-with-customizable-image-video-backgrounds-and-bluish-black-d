# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename the app to TickTaskTime and clarify the “Publish to the App Market” instructions for Caffeine publishing.

**Planned changes:**
- Update frontend branding so the app name shows as “TickTaskTime” in the header and browser tab title, with no remaining “TickTask” in UI chrome.
- Revise the “Publish to the App Market” section in the Publish & Share sheet to provide clear, step-by-step English instructions that reference using Caffeine’s UI after the app is Live (without automating submission).

**User-visible outcome:** The app is labeled “TickTaskTime” in the header and browser tab, and users see clearer Caffeine-specific steps for publishing to the App Market in the Publish & Share sheet.
