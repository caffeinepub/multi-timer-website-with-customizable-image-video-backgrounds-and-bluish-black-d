  "summary": "REQ-1 and most of REQ-2 appear implemented by introducing a reusable MinutesSecondsInput that decomposes/stores durations as total seconds and by wiring it into IntervalTimer with disabled state while running. REQ-3 is partially implemented: the Publish & Share sheet adds clearer preview-mode warning copy and a “go live” checklist, but the diff does not show a distinct ‘public URL’ being displayed/handled separately from the current/preview URL.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Publish & Share sheet clearly distinguishes between the current preview/draft URL and the public URL that appears after going live.",
      "reason": "The sheet shows only `currentUrl` (window.location.href) labeled as 'Preview URL (This Session)' when embedded, plus guidance text about using the Live tab to get a public URL. The diff does not show any separate 'public URL' value/field being displayed or differentiated beyond instructions.",
