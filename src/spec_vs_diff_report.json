  "summary": "The diff implements boot-time validation/clearing for persisted image/video backgrounds, avoids persisting transient runtime error state, and adds an in-overlay \"Clear background\" recovery action. It also adds YouTube fatal-error auto-clear behavior. One non-requested change updates project_state.json metadata.",
