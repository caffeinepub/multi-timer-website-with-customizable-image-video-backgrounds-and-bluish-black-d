  "summary": "REQ-3 (Reminders) and REQ-4 (toggleable completion alerts) appear to be implemented via new reminders feature files and a TimerAlerts provider/settings wired into multiple timer types. REQ-1 (timers continue across tab switches) is likely addressed by force-mounting timer tabs (per diff summary notes), though the App.tsx diff is truncated. REQ-2 (primary button color #9E1C37) is partially addressed by updating CSS theme tokens, but the diff does not clearly show an explicit hex-based primary background being applied, so exact computed color compliance cannot be confirmed from the summary alone.",

      "requirement": "Update the primary button styling so buttons use hex color #9E1C37 as the primary (default) button background color across the app (including light/dark themes), without editing files under `frontend/src/components/ui`.",
      "reason": "The diff shows updates to CSS variables using OKLCH values with a comment claiming #9E1C37, but it does not provide evidence that the computed primary button background resolves exactly to hex #9E1C37 across themes (as required by the AC).",
