  "summary": "The diff implements YouTube background support end-to-end: a new YouTube tab/input in Background Settings, a new background mediaType ('youtube') with localStorage persistence, robust-ish URL parsing for common YouTube formats, and full-viewport iframe rendering configured for background playback (autoplay/mute/loop/controls off) with an on-screen autoplay guidance message.",

      "description": "Introduces usage of an additional icon library (`react-icons`) for the YouTube tab icon.",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest did not ask to add/introduce any new UI/icon dependencies; the diff shows a new import from `react-icons/si`, implying an extra dependency or at least new usage beyond the specified requirements.",
