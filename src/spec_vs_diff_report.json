  "summary": "The diff removes the global dim/blur overlay over active backgrounds in `BackgroundStage` and renders image/video/YouTube backgrounds at full-viewport with no apparent CSS dimming/blur filters. It also adjusts UI surface opacity/blur and text shadow to maintain timer readability without reintroducing a full-screen overlay, while keeping a distinct readable error overlay when background rendering fails.",
