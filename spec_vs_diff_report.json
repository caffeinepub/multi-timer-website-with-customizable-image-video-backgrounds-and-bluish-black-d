  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 comprehensively. A new BackgroundFullscreenButton component is added that uses the browser's native Fullscreen API (requestFullscreen/exitFullscreen), toggles between Maximize2 and Minimize2 icons, tracks fullscreen state via the 'fullscreenchange' event (including Escape key exits), only renders when a background is active (image, video, or YouTube), and targets the stageRef element from BackgroundProvider. The button is integrated into App.tsx. The stageRef is exposed from useBackground.ts and passed through BackgroundProvider context. BackgroundStage is refactored to use a single root div with the stageRef so the Fullscreen API targets the entire stage. All acceptance criteria appear satisfied.",

      "reason": "The build request explicitly states as a non-goal: 'Adding fullscreen support for the timer overlay or any non-background UI elements.' The diff summary mentions BackgroundCustomizer.tsx was extended with a timer overlay toggle for fullscreen, which was not requested and is explicitly excluded.",
