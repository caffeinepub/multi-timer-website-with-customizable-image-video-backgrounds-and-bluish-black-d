  "summary": "The diff implements both REQ-1 (pink/crimson theme for toggles and buttons) and REQ-2 (Spotify music support) with reasonable coverage. REQ-1 is applied to TimerVisibilityBar and TasksPanel with new CSS variables and Tailwind tokens. REQ-2 is addressed in MusicSettings.tsx with updated placeholder/help text and Spotify icon. However, the diff does not include changes to musicSupport.ts (Spotify URL detection/conversion logic) or MusicStage.tsx (Spotify embed iframe rendering), which are explicitly required by REQ-2.",
