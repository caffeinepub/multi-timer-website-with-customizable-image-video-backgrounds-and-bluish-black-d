  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 by changing App.tsx to keep timer components always mounted using CSS 'hidden' class instead of conditional rendering, so running timers are never interrupted when the 'hide timer' toggle is clicked. The file-diff summary explicitly confirms this approach. The implementation appears to directly address the root cause of the bug.",
