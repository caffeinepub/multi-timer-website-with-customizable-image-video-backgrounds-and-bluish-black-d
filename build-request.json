      "text": "Fix the 'hide timer' toggle in the TimerVisibilityBar so that toggling timer visibility does not reset or restart any running timer (countdown, stopwatch, pomodoro, interval, or repeating). The toggle should only affect the visual display of the timer panel, leaving all timer state (elapsed time, running status, remaining time) completely unchanged.",

        "Starting a countdown timer and then toggling 'hide timer' does not reset the countdown or pause it unexpectedly.",
